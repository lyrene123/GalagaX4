# GalagaX4
C# Final Project Semester 3, Fall 2016 <br>
Galaga/Space Invaders Game WPF Application written in C# <br>

_Note_: This was our final project in Software Development class 2nd year CompSci and it was our very first
attempt to develop a huge project with Object Oriented Programming and our first time using Git for project collaboration. We did not follow the right team workflow (protected branches, PRs, issues, etc) and commit messages were ..... not so good.
